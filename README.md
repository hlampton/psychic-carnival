# Weather Dashboard

## Description
This project I built a weather dashboard that displays the current weather and a five day forecast when you search a city. Also, that city you searched is stored in local storage and a button is created so you can easily reload that cities data. Using openweathermap API the city searched is called and the data is retreived via JSON. I used AJAX to retieve the information from the API, previously I was using the fetch method so this is a whole new way to pull data, I learned a lot and became comfortable with AJAX. My project stands out because I used AJAX instead of fetch, which is what we were using mainly in class.

## Technologies
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX, JQuery, Dayjs, and openweathermap API.
